description: AI rules derived by SpecStory from the project AI interaction history
globs: *
---

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
- The AI coding assistant is responsible for maintaining and evolving a comprehensive rules file that governs all aspects of the project, including coding standards, workflow, and documentation.
- The rules file is a "living" document, updated with each new user–AI interaction to reflect new guidelines, clarifications, and decisions.
- The goal is to ensure consistency, maintainability, and best practices throughout the project.

## CODE STYLE
- Adhere to established code style guidelines.
- Use clear, concise, and well-documented code.
- Prioritize readability and maintainability.
- Follow StyleX property ordering.

## FOLDER ORGANIZATION
- Maintain a consistent and logical folder structure.
- Group related files and components together.
- Use meaningful names for folders and files.

## TECH STACK
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- React
- StyleX
- React Aria Components
- Lucide React
- MDX

## PROJECT-SPECIFIC STANDARDS
- When creating new components, follow the hip-ui component structure:
    - Create a component file (e.g., `index.tsx`).
    - Create a config file (e.g., `component-config.ts`) that lists dependencies.
    - Register the component in `packages/hip-ui/src/cli/install.tsx`.
    - Create a documentation MDX file in `apps/docs/src/docs/components`.
    - Create basic example file(s) in `apps/docs/src/examples`.
- Use theme tokens for styling to maintain consistency.
- When using StyleX, adhere to its conventions, especially regarding property ordering and pseudo-class syntax.
- Use React Aria components where appropriate for accessibility and behavior.
- When creating examples, use system components instead of raw HTML elements (e.g., `Heading1` instead of `h1`).
- When implementing layouts, consider the `Content` component for applying consistent spacing styles.
- When components require a size prop, it should be handled using the SizeContext.
- When creating a component with slots, export the component and all of the slots using a namespace pattern (e.g. `SidebarLayout.Root`, `SidebarLayout.Sidebar`, `SidebarLayout.Page`).
- When working with StyleX, always define style variables at the top of the file.
- When creating responsive StyleX properties, use utility types like `ResponsiveValue<T>` to define the prop type. Note that the implementation must handle responsive objects (objects with breakpoints) correctly.

## WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES
- Each new user–AI interaction may result in updates to the rules file.
- Review new interactions carefully and merge any relevant guidelines, clarifications, or best practices into the appropriate sections of the rules file.
- If a new rule conflicts with an existing one, resolve the conflict by clarifying the final, decided rule or highlighting that further user confirmation is needed.
- Before merging changes, ensure that the codebase is free of linting errors.
- Use pull requests for code reviews and approvals.
- Increment version numbers appropriately when releasing new versions.

## REFERENCE EXAMPLES
- Refer to existing components and documentation for guidance on structure, styling, and best practices.
- Examples:
    - `packages/hip-ui/src/components/button/index.tsx`
    - `packages/hip-ui/src/components/card/index.tsx`
    - `packages/hip-ui/src/components/header-layout/index.tsx`
    - `packages/hip-ui/src/components/footer/index.tsx`
- When creating new components, match the structure of composite components such as footer or header-layout which have Root and other sub-components.

## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM
- Create clear and concise documentation for all components and features.
- Use JSDoc comments to document props and component behavior.
- Follow the existing documentation structure in `apps/docs/src/docs/components`.
- Include examples of how to use components in different contexts.
- When creating MDX examples, use system components not HTML ones.
- Use `PropDocs` component to autogenerate props documentation.

## DEBUGGING
- Use console logging and debugging tools to identify and fix issues.
- Write unit tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
- Verify that changes do not introduce new linting errors.
- Use `pnpm eslint --fix` to automatically fix linting issues where possible.
- When debugging StyleX styles, make sure that the StyleX properties are in the correct order.
