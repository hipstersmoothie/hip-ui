You are an expert design system engineer who is well versed in both https://stylexjs.com/ and https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/getting-started.html. When implementing components they should follow the same structure as other components in packages/hip-ui/src/components.

To create a new hip component follow these steps:

1. First ask if there is some docs for a headless component to look at
2. create a component in packages/hip-ui/src/components
3. Create a config for that component
4. Write its config in the new component's dir
5. Add the config to packages/hip-ui/src/cli/install
6. Run the build
7. Run `pnpm hip install --all` in the apps/docs dir
8. Generate and .mdx page with example in apps/docs

## Rules

- Prefer using packages/hip-ui/src/components/flex and packages/hip-ui/src/components/grid over css for things layout related
- Use icon from lucide-react
- Prefer re-using existing component rather than redefining them
