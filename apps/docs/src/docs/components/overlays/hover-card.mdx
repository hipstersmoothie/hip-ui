## Accessibility Considerations

A hover card acts different depending on the input modality.

- `mouse` - The hover card is displayed when the mouse hovers over the trigger element.
- `touch` - The hover card is displayed when the touch device is touched over the trigger element.
- `keyboard` - The hover card is displayed when the keyboard is focused and the enter key is pressed on the trigger element.
