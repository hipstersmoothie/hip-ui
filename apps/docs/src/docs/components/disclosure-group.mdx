## Installation

Run the following command to add the disclosure-group component to your project.

```bash
pnpm hip install disclosure-group
```

## Props

This component is built using [React Aria DisclosureGroup](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/DisclosureGroup.html).

<PropDocs components={["DisclosureGroup"]} />

## Features

### Default Expanded

A DisclosureGroup can have one or more disclosures expanded by default using the `defaultExpandedKeys` prop. The keys must match the `id` props on the child Disclosure components.

<Example src={DefaultExpanded} />

### Multiple Expanded

By default, DisclosureGroup allows only one disclosure to be expanded at a time (accordion behavior). You can enable multiple expanded items by setting `allowsMultipleExpanded` to `true`.

<Example src={MultipleExpanded} />

### Sizes

DisclosureGroup supports three different sizes: small, medium, and large. The size prop is passed down to all child Disclosure components via SizeContext.

<Example src={Sizes} />
