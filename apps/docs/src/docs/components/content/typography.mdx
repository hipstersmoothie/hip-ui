```

## Props

This is a custom component collection built for typography.

## Typeramp

The typeramp is a composed system that combines individual tokens into semantic text styles.
Instead of manually combining tokens each time you need styled text, the typeramp provides pre-composed styles for common use cases.

### Why Use a Typeramp?

A typeramp provides several key benefits when developing applications:

1. **Consistency**: Ensures all text follows the same visual hierarchy and spacing rules
2. **Efficiency**: Reduces the need to manually combine tokens for common text patterns
3. **Maintainability**: Changes to the design system can be made in one place
4. **Accessibility**: Built-in responsive behavior and proper contrast ratios
5. **Semantic Meaning**: Styles are named for their purpose rather than their appearance

### Responsive Behavior

The typeramp includes responsive font sizes that automatically adjust based on screen size. For example, `heading1` uses `fontSize["4xl"]` on mobile and `fontSize["5xl"]` on medium screens and up.

## Features

### Text Variants

The Body and Label components support secondary variants for styling.

<Example src={TextVariants} />

### Lists

Typography also includes list components.

<Example src={Lists} />

### Blockquote  

Typography also includes a blockquote component.

<Example src={BlockquoteExample} />

### Inline Code

Typography also includes an inline code component.

<Example src={InlineCodeExample} />
