<Example src={Basic} />

## Installation

Run the following command to add the form component to your project.

```bash
pnpm hip install form
```

## Props

This component is built using [React Aria Form](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Form.html).

<PropDocs components={["Form"]} />

## Features

### Server-Side Validation

Forms support server-side validation by providing error messages through the `validationErrors` prop. The errors are displayed to the user as soon as they are set, and cleared after the user modifies each field's value.

<Example src={WithValidation} />

### Submit and Reset

Forms support both submit and reset functionality. The `onSubmit` event is triggered when a user submits the form with the Enter key or by pressing a submit button. The `onReset` event is triggered when a user presses a reset button.

<Example src={WithSubmitAndReset} />
