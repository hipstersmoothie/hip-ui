import { GrayColors, UiColors } from "../../examples/foundations/color";

## Apprach

We use a semantic color palette approach to define our colors.
Each color has an intended use case and is named accordingly.

Read more about the approach in the [Radix Color Docs](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors/docs/palette-composition/understanding-the-scale).

## Base Colors

The UI is built on top of the Radix Color palette.
There are two type of colors you'll work with:

### Gray Colors

The gray color is used to style the background and borders of the UI.
Each one of these colors matches the tone of a particular UI color.

<GrayColors />

### UI Colors

These colors are used to style the "primary" state of the UI.
This typically matches your brand color.

### Scale

Each color is a scale of 12 colors.
Every color has a specific use:

- `bg` - App background color
- `bgSubtle` - Subtle background color
- `component1` - UI Element background
- `component2` - Hovered UI Element background
- `component3` - Active/Selected UI Element background
- `border1` - Subtle border color
- `border2` - UI Element border color and focus rings
- `border3` - Solid border color
- `solid1` - Solid color
- `solid2` - Hovered solid color
- `text1` - Low contrast text color
- `text2` - High contrast text color

## Semantic Colors

For the most part you should not work with the base colors directly.
Instead, use the semantic colors that are defined in the `semantic-color.stylex.tsx` file.

Each of these colors represent speficic use cases.
You can edit the semantic colors to any of the included base colors to esaily update the base theme.

There are four semantic colors:

- `ui` - The color of the application UI.
- `primary` - The primary color used for the main brand.
- `success` - The color of the successful actions.
- `warning` - The color of the warning actions.
- `critical` - The color of the error actions.

### Usage

Use the semantic colors to style your components.

```tsx
import { uiColor } from "@/components/theme/color.stylex";
import * as stylex from "@stylexjs/stylex";

const styles = stylex.create({
  container: {
    backgroundColor: uiColor.bg,
    color: uiColor.text1,
  },
});
```

## Semantic Color Classes

For convenience, we also provide semantic color classes that you can use to style your components.

```tsx
import { ui } from "@/components/theme/semantic-color.stylex";
import { Flex } from "@/components/flex";

export function MyComponent() {
  return <Flex style={[ui.bg, ui.text1]}>My Component</Flex>;
}
```

### List of classes

Each color includes 2 sets of classes.

#### Utility

For each step in the scale, we include a utility class that makes sense for the color.

For example:

- `ui.bg` => sets the background color to `uiColor.bg`
- `ui.borderDim` => sets the border color to `uiColor.border1`

#### Pattern

We also include some classes that compose multiple steps in the scale for hover and active states.

- `borderInteractive`
- `bgGhost`
- `bgUi`
- `bgAction`
- `bgSolidAction`
