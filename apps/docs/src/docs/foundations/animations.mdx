import { AnimationDurations, AnimationTimingFunctions, AllAnimations } from "../../examples/foundations/animations";

Animations provide smooth transitions and visual feedback throughout the UI.
Our animation system includes predefined keyframe animations, duration tokens, and timing function tokens that ensure consistent motion across your application.

## Usage

To use animations, import them from the animations theme file:

```tsx
import { animations, animationDuration, animationTimingFunction } from "@/components/theme/animations.stylex";

const styles = stylex.create({
  animated: {
    animationName: animations.fadeIn,
    animationDuration: animationDuration.default,
    animationTimingFunction: animationTimingFunction.easeInOut,
  },
});
```

## Animation Duration

Animation duration tokens control how long an animation takes to complete.
Use these tokens to maintain consistent timing across your application.

- **fast**: 100ms - For quick, subtle animations
- **default**: 150ms - The standard duration for most animations
- **slow**: 200ms - For more noticeable transitions
- **verySlow**: 300ms - For prominent, attention-grabbing animations
- **extremelySlow**: 500ms - For very slow animations

## Animation Timing Functions

Timing functions control the acceleration and deceleration of animations, creating different motion feels.

- **linear**: Constant speed throughout the animation
- **easeIn**: Starts slow and accelerates (cubic-bezier curve)
- **easeOut**: Starts fast and decelerates (cubic-bezier curve)
- **easeInOut**: Slow start, fast middle, slow end (cubic-bezier curve)
- **easeElasticOut**: Elastic out (cubic-bezier curve)
- **easeElasticIn**: Elastic in (cubic-bezier curve)
- **easeElasticInOut**: Elastic in and out (cubic-bezier curve)
- **easeSpring**: Spring-like easing (linear curve)

## Animations

The following keyframe animations are available for use in your components.
Click on any animation box to see it in action.

- **fadeIn/fadeOut**: Fades an element in from transparent to opaque
- **zoomIn/zoomOut**: Scales an element from 80% to 100% size
- **slideInRight/slideOutRight**: Slides in from the right
- **slideInLeft/slideOutLeft**: Slides in from the left
- **slideInTop/slideOutTop**: Slides in from the top
- **slideInBottom/slideOutBottom**: Slides in from the bottom
