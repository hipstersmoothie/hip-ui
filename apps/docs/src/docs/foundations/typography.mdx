Typography is a fundamental design system component that ensures consistent and readable text across your application.
Our typography system is built on a foundation of design tokens and composed into semantic type styles.

This page documents the tokens that compose the typography system.
In most cases you will not need to use the tokens directly, but instead use the [Typography Components](/docs/components/typography) or the [Text Component](/docs/components/text) to create styled text.

## Tokens

Design tokens are the atomic building blocks of our typography system.
They provide consistent values for font properties that can be used throughout your application.

### Font Family

The font family tokens define the typefaces available in the system:

- **sans**: Inter font family for body text and UI elements
- **serif**: Georgia serif font for emphasis, special content or headings
- **mono**: Monaco monospace font for code and technical content

<Example src={FontFamilies} />

### Font Weight

We provide the full scale of font weights from thin to black.
In general you should avoid using the lighter weights, as they can harm the readability of the text.

<Example src={FontWeights} />

### Font Size

Font size tokens create a harmonious scale from small text to large headings:

<Example src={FontSizes} />

### Line Height

Line height tokens ensure optimal readability by providing appropriate spacing between lines:

<Example src={LineHeights} />

### Letter Spacing (Tracking)

Letter spacing tokens control the space between characters:

<Example src={LetterSpacing} />
