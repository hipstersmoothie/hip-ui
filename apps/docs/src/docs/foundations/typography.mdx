Typography is a fundamental design system component that ensures consistent and readable text across your application.
Our typography system is built on a foundation of design tokens and composed into semantic type styles.

## Tokens

Design tokens are the atomic building blocks of our typography system.
They provide consistent values for font properties that can be used throughout your application.

### Font Family

The font family tokens define the typefaces available in the system:


- **sans**: Inter font family for body text and UI elements
- **serif**: Georgia serif font for emphasis, special content or headings
- **mono**: Monaco monospace font for code and technical content

<Example src={FontFamilies} />

### Font Weight

We provide the full scale of font weights from thin to black.
In general you should avoid using the lighter weights, as they can harm the readability of the text.

<Example src={FontWeights} />

### Font Size

Font size tokens create a harmonious scale from small text to large headings:

<Example src={FontSizes} />

### Line Height

Line height tokens ensure optimal readability by providing appropriate spacing between lines:

<Example src={LineHeights} />

### Letter Spacing (Tracking)

Letter spacing tokens control the space between characters:

<Example src={LetterSpacing} />

## Typeramp

The typeramp is a composed system that combines individual tokens into semantic text styles.
Instead of manually combining tokens each time you need styled text, the typeramp provides pre-composed styles for common use cases.

<Example src={Typeramp} />

### Why Use a Typeramp?

A typeramp provides several key benefits when developing applications:

1. **Consistency**: Ensures all text follows the same visual hierarchy and spacing rules
2. **Efficiency**: Reduces the need to manually combine tokens for common text patterns
3. **Maintainability**: Changes to the design system can be made in one place
4. **Accessibility**: Built-in responsive behavior and proper contrast ratios
5. **Semantic Meaning**: Styles are named for their purpose rather than their appearance

### Responsive Behavior

The typeramp includes responsive font sizes that automatically adjust based on screen size. For example, `heading1` uses `fontSize["4xl"]` on mobile and `fontSize["5xl"]` on medium screens and up.
